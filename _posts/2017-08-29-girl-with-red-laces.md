Ben Thompson’s take, published yesterday, makes several interesting points. 
He absolutely observes that Ive’s newly-promoted lieutenants, 
Alan Dye (UI Desing) and Richard Howarth (industrial design), 
both were featured prominently in recent feature articles granting access to 
Apple executives:

> The message again, is clear: when Ive took over software, Dye was there.
  
> Indeed, taken as a whole, this entire episode is a masterful display of 
  public relations: plant the seeds of this story in two articles — 
  ostensibly about the Watch — that provide unprecedented access to Apple 
  broadly and Apple’s design team in particular, and happen to highlight two 
  designers in particular, neither of whom had any public profile to date 
  (kind of — as John Gruber and I discussed on The Talk Show — Dye is a 
  polarizing figure in Apple circles). Then, after a presumably successful 
  Watch launch, announce on a holiday — when the stock market is closed — 
  that these two newly public designers have newly significant roles at Apple.
           
## A brief interpolation on Alan Dye

There are two basic ways to read<!--more--> this news. The first is to take Apple at its
word — that this is a promotion for Ive that will let him focus more of his 
attention on, well, design. That he’s delegating management administrivia to 
Dye and Howarth, not decreasing his involvement in supervising the actual
design work. The second way — the cynical way — is that this is the first 
step to Ive easing his way out the door, and that his new title is spin to 
make the news sound good rather than bad.

In short: is this truly a promotion for Ive, or is it (as Thompson punctuated
it) a quote-unquote “promotion”?

One reason for skepticism is the odd way the story was announced, 
via a feature profile of Ive (and to a lesser degree, 
Tim Cook) by Stephen Fry [^1]. It was an odd article and an even odder way for 
Apple to announce the news. One line from the article caught many observers’ 
attention (boldface emphasis added):

> When I catch up with Ive alone, I ask him why he has seemingly relinquished 
  the two departments that had been so successfully under his control. “Well, 
  I’m still in charge of both,” he says, “I am called Chief Design Officer. 
  Having Alan and Richard in place frees me up from some of the administrative 
  and management work which isn’t … which isn’t …”
  
[^1]: One small oddity. As of this writing it’s been over two days since 
Ive’s promotion was announced, but Apple’s “Executive Profiles” page still 
hasn't been updated. Usually Apple has things like this staged and ready to 
go. UPDATE: A few readers have suggested that Apple technically can’t update 
this page yet, because the new titles aren’t effective until July 1. Makes 
sense. So maybe file this entire footnoted “oddity” under “never mind”.
