Hanging out around John Lennon’s wall.
Yup there is one in Prague, though the guy never been here i think. You may 
scratch your head what’s up with that but let me explain.
 
John[^1] was kind of a hero to the youth of Central and Eastern Europe during 
the 
communist era. In the time when western pop songs were banned by authorities, 
some musician were actually jailed for playing Lennon songs that praised 
freedom people didn’t have here. When Lennon was murdered he became even more 
glorified and many of his pictures were painted right here on these bricks 
along with famous pieces of lyrics from Beatles songs and political messages. 
Quickly the wall became an outlet for all the and defiance and irritations 
against communist regime. Over and over again authorities tried to clean the 
wall but next morning it was all filled up again by locals with new layers of 
paint, poems and flowers.
 
Today the wall is covered with graffiti, scribbles and sentences about love 
and peace. It is constantly changing and shuffling with new tags but i spotted
one i think i’ve remembered from the last visit. It catches my eye and makes 
me go down the memory lane.
 
> If they don’t let us dream we're gonna fuck them hard in the ass until
they understand there is no way going back to the world war crisis. It's 
gonna be supernice to be among one of the most important people on the 
planet so i guess it's nothing i can do.

*Aretha Franklin* that can’t be right but i digress. Anyway, the spirit of 
the wall lives on i think. Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Even though it’s been awhile, people still come here to paint their own feelings 
and dreams and that’s kind of cool. Now is the time for all good men to come to 
*the aid of their country*. This is just a regular paragraph. 

### Now let's talk about some lists in Prague

Today the wall is covered with ***graffiti***, scribbles and sentences about 
love and peace. It is constantly changing and shuffling with new tags but i 
spotted one i think i’ve remembered from the last visit. It catches my eye and 
makes me go down the memory lane.

no chance to be outside that list. Try it you're love it !

Today the wall is covered with graffiti, scribbles and sentences about love 
and peace. It is constantly changing and shuffling with new tags but i spotted 
one i think i’ve remembered from the last visit. It catches my eye and makes me 
go down the memory lane. “Don’t let me loose this dream” by someone that 
can’t be right but i digress. Anyway, the spirit of the wall lives on i think.
