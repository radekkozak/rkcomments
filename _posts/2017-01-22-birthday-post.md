![I want to go to Prague for my birthday !]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/birthday.jpg)

Today the wall is covered with ***graffiti***, scribbles and sentences about 
love and peace. It is constantly changing and shuffling with new tags but i 
spotted one i think i’ve remembered from the last visit. It catches my eye and 
makes me go down the memory<!--more--> lane.

* Candy.
* Gum.
* Booze.
* Red
* Green
* Blue
* A list item with more than one line this can go on and on until there is 
no chance to be outside that list. Try it you're love it !
* Another item in the list.
* This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
  sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit
  mi posuere lectus. 
  
  Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
  vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
  sit amet velit.Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

* Another one after two paragrpahs item list

Today the wall is covered with graffiti, scribbles and sentences about love 
and peace. It is constantly changing and shuffling with new tags but i spotted 
one i think i’ve remembered from the last visit. It catches my eye and makes me 
go down the memory lane. “Don’t let me loose this dream” by someone that 
can’t be right but i digress. Anyway, the spirit of the wall lives on i think. 
Even though it’s been awhile, people still come here to paint their own feelings
and dreams and that’s kind of cool. Now is the time for all good men to come to 
the aid of their country. I don't want this: ~~loneliness~~
