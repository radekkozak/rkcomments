  description: Sicilians take their Easter season with grandness. All over the island, from large towns to tiny villages alike, processions weave their way through narrow streets, alleyways and piazzas. Statues are carried, candles are lit, traditional dishes cooked, birds that have been saved from the harsh mountain winter are freed. Local folks put on their traditional 15th Century costumes an set out into towns, some dancing in iron masks as devils, some handing out red hand-painted eggs. For the whole time of <i>Settimana Santa</i> local churches fill up with the faithful greeting each other with blessings and wishes of peace. One could go on and on as each part of the island, even each town varies in its Easter rituals, has its own symbols and religious re-enactments. Sicilian Pasqua is also the time that signals the arrival of Spring and it is very interesting to see some of  religious festivities mixed with pagan traditions that used to mark the arrival of the "beautiful season". This book is a photographic essay of my five year encounters with Sicilian Easter rites. But it's more than that. It's a testimony of hearty Sicilians upholding still their beliefs, a documentary record of them doing what they're been doing for over 400 years.
