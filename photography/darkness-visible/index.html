- Depression is an illness. According to WHO more than 300 million people worldwide is affected by it. Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in everyday life. Especially when long-lasting and with moderate or severe intensity, depression may become a serious health condition. It can cause the affected person to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, at school and in the family. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds<br/><br/>Twenty years ago today, the American novelist William Styron's short but devastating memoir about his depression and near-suicide, was published in the UK.
