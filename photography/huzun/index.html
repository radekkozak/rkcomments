descriptions:
- All melancholy cities resemble one another, but each one is melancholic in its own way. The <i>saudade</i> of Lisbon, <i>tristeza</i> of Burgos, <i>mestizia</i> of Turin, <i>traurigkeit</i> of Vienna, <i>ennui</i> of Alexandria or even the <i>ghostliness</i> of Prague - on the surface they all share some common sense of melancholy. This project is dedicated to <strong><i>hüzün</i></strong> which, according to Orhan Pamuk, is the melancholy of Istanbul. <i>Hüzün</i> is a Turkish word whose Arabic roots (it appears five times in the Quran) denotes a feeling of deep spiritual loss, but at the same time a hopeful way of looking at life, <i>a state of mind that (...) is ultimately as life-affirming as it is negating</i>... [ "The Washington Post" excerpt ]<br/><br/>I am particularly interested in the aspect of hüzün that is most enigmatic, namely that it is not only a singular preoccupation but also a communal emotion, not only the melancholy of an individual but also the black mood shared by millions of Turkish people. <i>What I am trying to explain,</i> - to quote Pamuk from his Istanbul book - <i>is the hüzün of an entire city of Istanbul</i>.
