- In Sicilian, the word <i>"cuore"</i> means many things. I've been trying to get the feel of its layered meanings since i first started photographing Sicilian Easter rites back in 2011. At my first <i>Settimana Santa</i> on the island i got it all wrong. I thought all of it boiled down to tradition. Then i slowly started to realize how wrong i was. Now i know it's all about <i>cuore</i>.<br/><br/>This collection of photographs, taken all over the island, is a record of my encounters with Sicilian Easter. I've been coming to Sicily in time of <i>Pasqua</i>, year after year, until 2015. Always finding something different, unexpected, something that kept me going. From never-ending nocturnal processions of Trapani, through theatrical Marsala, quiet Buseto to mystical processions in medieval Erice, high above on the rock. From small villages of Mezzojuso or Piana in the north to cold interior of Enna. Every year with more admiration for Sicilian people for sticking to their guts, for upholding all those 400-year old rituals. And it's more than just simple revival. It's all re-lived there. With sheer, raw emotion. With tears, fear, courage, reflection and profound sense of being a part of something bigger. For me it's been one of the most haunting and emotional experiences of my life and i'm thankful for all of it.
