- Like that boy lurking somewhere outside the frame, i've been trying to get a glimpse of what Easter traditions means to Sicilians. It's been almost six years since my first visit on this strange island. I've been coming there year after year, from 2012 to 2016, in time of <i>Settimana Santa</i>. Always finding something different, unexpected, something that kept me going, that whispered i should explore even more. From west coast to east. From never-ending nocturnal processions of Trapani, through theatrical Marsala and quiet Buseto to mystical processions in medieval Erice high above on the rock. From small villages of Mezzojuso or Piana in the north to cold interior of Enna. There i was, with that curious attitude of the boy, trying to catch the essence of sicilian Pasqua. Every year with more admiration for Sicilian people, for sticking to their guts, reviving all those 400 years old rituals, upholding their traditions. And it's all truly relived here, with sheer, raw emotion. With tears, fear, courage, reflection and profound sense of being a part of something bigger. For me it's been one of the most haunting and emotional experiences of my life and i'm thankful i could be a small part of all that.
