**Radek Kozak** (b. 1984 in Strzyżów, Poland) — photographer whose work borders on the classic documentary, street photography and fine art. His main area of focus revolves mostly around long-term projects and small narratives. In his work Radek is interested in various topics among which are intersections of photography, language and memory, as well as the notions of identity and belonging, especially in regard to relations between people and places. Recently he's been also exploring social and political issues in his home country by concentrating on more close-by and intimate stories. In 2015 he published his first book *Cuore* — a photographic essay on Sicilian Easter rites that has spanned his five years of travel and documentary work on the island.

Radek studied Philosophy at the Faculty of Philosophy & Sociology of the University of Warsaw. He is also a graduate at Cracow University of Technology from which he obtained his MSc degree. Beyond everything he's an avid wanderer, translator, poet and occasional essayist. He's been published in various periodicals, printed and online. In recent years he was nominated in two major nationwide poetic contests: "Połów" in 2016, awarded by Literary Bureau — founder and organizer of the oldest poetic festival in Poland, and in 2017 for the "Large Format" award for his sheet of poetry titled *"The Lemniscate of Hand"*. Currently he is based in Warsaw where he continues his studies and works on his debut poetry book.
