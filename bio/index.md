**Radek Kozak** (b. 1984 in Strzyżów, Poland) is a photographer whose work borders on the classic documentary, street photography and fine art. Working both in black & white medium as well as in color, his photography focuses mostly on long-term projects. In 2015 Radek Kozak published his first book, *Cuore* - a photographic essay on Sicilian Easter rites that has spanned his five year documentary work on the island. This award-winning photography book, filled with his own texts, tries to explain what Easter traditions means to Sicilian people. Based on his travels between 2011 and 2015, the book's narrative combines together an extensive and haunting imagery with glimpses and reflections of personal travelogue. 

Radek Kozak studied philosophy in Institute of Philosophy at University of Warsaw and holds MS degree at Cracow University of Technology, Poland. He is also a published essayist and poet, nominated in two nationwide poetic prizes: in 2016 for "Połów", awarded by Literary Bureau's - organizer of the oldest poetic festival in Poland, and in 2017 for the prestigious "Large Format" award.

<br/>
"Looking at Kozak's imagery it's hard to not notice his finely woven path between visual and poetic narration. These photographs are quite beautiful and rare intersection of both those worlds. On a photographic note Kozak's work seems to draw from Alex Webb, Alan Harvey and maybe from few others, but it's not all that is to it. His interesting blend seems to have his own distinctive twist to it and that's something."

<br/>
"(...) his photographs are like those small worlds that seem to have the whole world in them"

<br/>
"Kozak's photographs seem to have their own weird connections between them, revealed even more when studied in sequences. Those micro narrations are what his work seems to be strongly about..."

<br/>
"Touching on the cultural and social tensions, clashes of modern and tradition, of public versus private, Kozak's unique visual language, oftentimes very evocative and enigmatic, tries to bring together many different elements of both visual and non-visual world. His intense work with both light and color, mixed with an intimate approach to both an individual subject and culture as general - something that he calls "discovering the poetics of the place" - is very much visible in his photographic spectrum. Themes such as street, past & present, the notion of time, melancholia, empathy or the works of memory (but surprisingly also of an irony and humor) - they all seem to inhabit Kozak's imagery. Mixed and blurred with each other. The most interesting though, Kozak's photographs, apart from being oftentimes complex and quite layered, all seem to be haunted with a deeper story and meaning. Meaning that he deliberately and generously leaves for the viewer to unravel, at the same time granting his own work something very important: a breath of air."

> I've always been interested in what's being called nowadays as an anthropology of everyday experience - no matter where i'm photographing. But in a search of hard evidence of that i've always seem to catch more of what's invisible than the other way around, more of that what lurks behind or sometimes even pushed down just below the surface. I'm afraid it's totally unconscious on my part. I mean, the line between visual phenomena and the unseen is always blurred for me when i am roaming the streets. Only after, when i study photographs i've taken, i learn something more meaningful about the gap between them. But right there, in the field, i am more instinctual i'm afraid.

about the process:

> In tides of good humor i often joke of myself as being an amateur anthropologist. Also the storytelling approach on its own is also very important to me. This is why in my travels i always carry on me an old notepad in which i try to write religiously on daily basis. On the spot though i've been using lately a voice recorder. It's a habit now, that i find most suitable when it comes to gripping myself in unfamiliar place. This is also why, more often than not, i have some stories behind every picture. Having said all that i must confess i never try to go to particular place with preconceived notion of what it all might be. What i generally do is just walking the streets and letting myself discover what my feeling of a place and my response to it will be like. In other words, i let my relationship (it is indeed quite often a poetic relationship - i admit) with the place develop naturally. I still find those moments when its idiosyncrasy reveals itself for a split of the moment, fascinating. 

about the conversation between photography and literature:

> If literature (poetry in particular) taught me anything, it is to approach and investigate every subject slowly and attentively. It's funny. There is a magnum photographer Newsha Tavakolian who - describing her own photographic process - coincidentally described (almost to the point) mine as well. Yes, i too do like to work unhurriedly, to have and take my time. I think the ever-popular notion of "blending in" can easily be a result of that. Such approach worked for me in Sicily and it worked for me in Turkey. Both places have their own challenges when it comes to photography, especially in case of religious festivities. As Newsha though, i will find myself hanging around at particular places and gatherings for hours, after which i simply stop getting noticed. Everything after that is just being present and watchful. In my view poetry teaches that just as well as meditation.
